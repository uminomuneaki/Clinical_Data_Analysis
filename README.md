Introduction
I cleaned 3 datafiles based on a clinical trial by gathering, assesing(defying quality and tidiness issues),
and cleaning data. By doing that, I was able to find more accurate, trastworthy result from each data files.

Datafiles I used for this analysis are not real clinical data, although it is messy enough to perform data cleaning.
